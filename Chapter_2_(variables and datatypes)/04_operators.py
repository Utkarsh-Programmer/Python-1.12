# Arithmetic Operators...
a = 7
b = 4

c = a+b  # addition
# print(c)

# print(c-3) # subtraction

# print(c*3) # multiplication

# print(c/3) # division


# Assignment Operators...
b = 6  # assign 6 to b

# b += 3  # increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

# b -= 3  # decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

# b *= 3  # multiply the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

# b /= 3  # divide the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)


# Comparison Operators...
# print(5 > 3)  # greater than
# print(5 < 3)  # less than
# print(5 <= 3)  # greater than or equal to
# print(5 >= 3)  # less than or equal to
# print(5 == 5)  # equal to
# print(5 != 3)  # not equal to


# Logical Operators...
# truth table of `or`
# print("True or False is ", True or False)
# print("True or True is ", True or True)
# print("False or True is ", False or True)
# print("False or False is ", False or False)

# truth table of `and`
# print("True and False is ", True and False)
# print("True and True is ", True and True)
# print("False and True is ", False and True)
# print("False and False is ", False and False)

# 'not' operator reverse the condition
